# Awniq

Awniq is an open-source aid operations platform for NGOs, charities, and small institutions.

The project is being built with Laravel as the main backend application foundation. The first phase currently includes the project skeleton, environment setup, a health-check API endpoint, and a starter admin frontend shell. No beneficiary, donation, inventory, or distribution business modules have been implemented yet.

## Local Setup

### 1. Clone The Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amrdev0/Awniq.git
cd Awniq
```

### 2. Configure The Laravel API

```bash
cd apps/api
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Create a MySQL database named:

```txt
awniq
```

Then update `apps/api/.env` if needed:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=awniq
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

Run the API:

```bash
php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000
```

Health check:

```txt
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "status": "ok",
    "service": "awniq-api",
    "environment": "local"
  },
  "message": "Operation completed successfully."
}
```

### 3. Configure The Admin Frontend

Open a second terminal:

```bash
cd apps/admin
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Admin URL:

```txt
http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

## Test Commands

Backend:

```bash
cd apps/api
composer lint
composer test
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd apps/admin
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
```

## GitHub Push Notes

The following local planning files are intentionally ignored and should not be pushed:

- `OpenImpact_OS_Project_Brief.md`
- `docs/`

Environment files are also ignored:

- `.env`
- `.env.*`

Only `.env.example` files should be committed.

## Roadmap

Next implementation phase:

1. Authentication
2. Organization setup
3. Branches
4. Users
5. Roles and permissions

Business modules such as beneficiaries, donors, donations, inventory, and aid distribution will be added after the authentication and organization foundation is complete.
